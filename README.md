Idle clicker in Python using Tkinter, first project with Python

This is my first major project with Python. I'm attempting to integrate a lot of book knowledge into something functional and fun. I'm always willing to accept suggestions or help, so if you see something, please feel free to reach out!

For much better examples of this style of game, look into Cookie Clicker or Adventure Capitalist

Current list of to-dos:

  Add more building types

  Add acheivements (just for fun!)

  Polish UI and possible graphics

To use as a new game, rename savefile_blank.dat to savefile.dat
To use with a game in progress, use current savefile.dat
