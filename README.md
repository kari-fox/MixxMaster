Idle clicker in Python using Tkinter, first project with Python

This is my first major project with Python. I'm attempting to integrate a lot of book knowledge into something functional and fun. I'm always willing to accept suggestions or help, so if you see something, please feel free to reach out!
For much better examples of this style of game, look into Cookie Clicker or Adventure Capitalist
Current list of to-dos:
  Get save/load working (attempting to use pickle, needs more research)
  Add more building types
  Add upgrades that apply overall benefits to game (speed increase, multipliers, ect.)
  Add acheivements (just for fun!)
  Polish UI and possible graphics
